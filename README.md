### Tips

1. Current version has a bug when import ics file to iPhone calendar.
2. The old version has a bug due to the dean platform update (One field was deleted in the new platform so the array indexing will throw an error).
3. The bug was fixed in the version above. However, safari still cannot download ics file. Maybe collaborators should study the format of ics file.

Thanks for any potential collaborators! Once you fix bug in `main.js`, just replace it with the code part in the shortcut download through the link above.
